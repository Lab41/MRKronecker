Stochastic Kronecker Graph Generation
=====================

A MapReduce implementation of the stochastic Kronecker graph generation model, based
on the paper [http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.4905](Kronecker graphs: an approach to modeling networks) by Leskovec et al.
For more information on our implementation of the algorithm, see [http://lab41.github.io/blog/2013/08/27/stochastic-kronecker-natural-graphs/](our blog post).
